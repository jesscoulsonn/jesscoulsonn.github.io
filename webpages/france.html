    <p> France is a country filled with people who immigrated from many different countries,
        this has made France a truely multicultural nation. This diverse population has allowed for a partiulary
        creative music scene. In the classical music field France has many well enstablished
        romatic composers, whilst folk and pop music have become more popular, and have lead to the 
        rise of the chanson and caberet style. Their are many French music artists that are internationally
        renowned, particulalry those producing and performing nouvelle, chanson and electronic music.
        Similarly to most other countries, the music produced within France has evolved with time, yet many musical
        pieces form centuries ago are still extremely popular today, with modern artists still perfoming songs
        written hundreds of years ago.

<h3>Classical Music</h3>

<p>The evolution of French classical music peaked during the Romantic Era in the 19th century.
    One of the most popular French composers of this time, and arguably the most innovative composer 
    of the early Romantic era was Hector Berlioz. For many, Berlioz holds a unique place in musical history;
    he was far ahead of his time.

    <p>After watching a performance of Romeo and Juliet at the Odeon Theatre in Paris Berloiz was inspired to create a musical 
    piece called Romeo et Juliette. This is a symmphonie dramtique, a large-scale choral symphony, and it is often
    argued as Berloiz's most comprehensive and detailed piece.The video shows the London Symphony Orchestra covering Romeo
    et Juliette, this shows how the music produced by Hector Berloiz is still admired today.

<h3>Folk Music</h3></div>

<div class="col-md-8">
<p> Traditional styles of folk music have survived well in most remote areas within France,
    such as the island of Corsica, and the moutainous region of Auvergne. Many areas have revived folk 
    tradtions recently to cater to tourists, pulling in attraction to their area. These revived folk 
    tradtions often have a heavy focus on very early 20th century melodies, paired with the the use of the piano
    accordion. A piano accordion is an accordion that is equipped with a right-hand keyboard similar to that 
    found on a piano or organ. It is believed that, the first piano accordion was introduced -in France in 1852, by Bouton of Paris.
